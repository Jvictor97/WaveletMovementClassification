	abstract = {Automatic and accurate identification of elbow angle from surface electromyogram (sEMG) is essential for myoelectric controlled upper limb exoskeleton systems. This requires appropriate selection of sEMG features, and identifying the limitations of such a system. This study has demonstrated that it is possible to identify three discrete positions of the elbow; full extension, right angle, and mid-way point, with window size of only 200 milliseconds. It was seen that while most features were suitable for this purpose, Power Spectral Density Averages (PSD-Av) performed best. The system correctly classified the sEMG against the elbow angle for 100\% cases when only two discrete positions (full extension and elbow at right angle) were considered, while correct classification was 89\% when there were three discrete positions. However, sEMG was unable to accurately determine the elbow position when five discrete angles were considered. It was also observed that there was no difference for extension or flexion phases.},

	abstract = {Surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals can be applied in medical, rehabilitation, robotic and industrial fields. As a typical application, a myoelectric prosthetic hand is controlled by the sEMG signals of the amputee’s residual muscles. To improve the dexterity of the myoelectric prosthetic hand, additional hand motion commands need to be classified. The more sEMG sensors are used, the more hand motion commands can be classified. However, the amputee’s residual muscles are limited. In order to improve the practicability of the myoelectric prosthetic hand, it is critical to investigate the effective pattern recognition algorithms to deal with the sEMG signals detected by fewer sensors, while identifying as many hand motion commands as possible. Current pattern recognition algorithms for sEMG signals are challenged by limited recognition patterns and unsteady classification accuracy rates. To solve these dilemmas, we employed discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and wavelet neural network (WNN) algorithms to improve the pattern recognition effects of sEMG signals. In addition, the back propagation and gradient descent algorithms were utilized to train WNN. In this work, we only used three sEMG sensors to classify and recognize six kinds of hand motion commands. The maximum identification accuracy rate is 100\%, and an average classification accuracy rate of the proposed wavelet neural network is 94.67\%, which is substantially better than the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes an integrated approach for the identification of daily hand movements with a view to control prosthetic members. The raw EMG signal is decomposed into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) with the use of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). A number of features are extracted in time and in frequency domain. Two different dimentionality methods are tested, namely the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique and the RELIEF feature selection algorithm. The outputs of the dimensionality reduction stage are then fed to a linear classifier to perform the detection task. The approach was tested on a group of young individuals and the results appear promising.},
